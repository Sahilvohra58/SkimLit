# SkimLit
Downloading a text dataset (PubMed RCT200k from GitHub). Writing a preprocessing function to prepare our data for modelling. Setting up a series of modelling experiments. Making a baseline (TF-IDF classifier) Deep models with different combinations of: token embeddings, character embeddings, pretrained embeddings, positional embeddings. Building our first multimodal model (taking multiple types of data inputs). Replicating the model architecture from https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.05251.pdf. Find the most wrong predictions. Making predictions on PubMed abstracts from the wild
